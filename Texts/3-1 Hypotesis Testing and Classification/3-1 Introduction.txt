Hello and welcome to the module on classification and hypothesis testing.
I'm David Garmanik from Sloan School of Management at MIT.
I'm also a member of Center for Statistics at IDSS.
My background is in applied probability, optimization, and algorithms.
And I regularly teach probability statistics and
optimization methods to Masters of Business Administration students.
I will teach this module jointly with Jon Kelner.
>> Hi, I'm Jonathan Kelner and I'm a professor in the Math Department and
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT.
My work also focuses on algorithms, optimization, and applied probability.
And I regularly teach classes on mathematical foundations of probability,
as well as on the algorithmic and computational techniques required to
manipulate, understand, and extract meaning from data.
At the beginning, we gave just one example of a concept commonly called
classification in the field of statistics and machine learning.
The goal of classification is to be able to place a given object into
the appropriate category based on its attributes,
typically given by data associated with this object.
In the credit card example, the object is the credit card transaction nd
there are two assigned categories, legitimate and fraud.
