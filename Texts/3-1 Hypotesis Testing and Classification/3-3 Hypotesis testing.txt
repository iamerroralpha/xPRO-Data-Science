Today, we will introduce a very important statistical concept.
Hypothesis testing.
The meaning of the term hypothesis testing is precisely what it says.
Using a data observed from a distribution with unknown parameters,
we hypothesize that the parameters of this distribution take particular value and
test the validity of this hypothesis using statistical methods.
We test a hypothesis.
The method of hypothesis testing has many applications.
Say a new drug for
lowering blood pressure was just produced by a certain pharmaceutical company.
Does the drug has a meaningful effect on lowering the blood pressure
as the company claims?
Is the impact larger than that of the competitive drugs.
A community organization claims that the police in a certain precinct is prejudiced
and tends to stop disproportionally many people of color during traffic patrols.
They have produced some data to support their claim showing
much larger number of people of color stopped than say, on average, across US.
A car manufacturer claims to have achieved a significantly lower emission rate
than those of its competitors and has provided data to support their claim.
The data supporting these kinds of claims
is naturally subject to a lot of uncertainty.
And one can never be completely certain whether or
not the claim has any validity to it.
One has to rely on statistical methods to draw such conclusions.
Today, we introduced some of this methods.
