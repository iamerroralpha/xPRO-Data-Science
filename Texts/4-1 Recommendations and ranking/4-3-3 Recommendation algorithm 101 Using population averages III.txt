You are thinking through this carefully, and
playing a bit of devil's advocate at this stage.
Is there any situation where the solution that we just found is not good?
Can you be too conservative?
To answer this, let us consider an example.
Suppose a brilliant but lesser known chef opens up a new restaurant.
Everyone who goes to the restaurant raves about it.
In a few weeks it gets four reviews, few genuine,
four reviews on Yelp which are all five stars.
In this case, double correction would suggest that the score of this restaurant
should be, well, 5, which is the average.
Minus correction,
which is 2.5 / square root of number of samples, here it being 4.
So it turns out to be, if you do the calculation, 3.75.
Well, this would mean that when we order restaurants by this adjusted score.
This new restaurant is potentially unlikely to show up in even top-ten
restaurants.
Because there would be many veteran restaurants with average score of 4.
Will this prevent this restaurant from ever becoming a top restaurant on Yelp?
No, not really.
Since hopefully over time enough people will visit the restaurant.
And then this would naturally bring
it to the top because correction would become smaller and smaller.
On the other hand, our conservative correction
will prevent it to be discovered early on by various Yelp users.
And this would make it longer for this restaurant to become popular.
So this suggests that our conscious conservative correction is preventing
some kind of exploration among users early on.
If we wanted to encourage some form of exploration then we should do
optimistic correction rather than the conservative correction.
That is the adjusted score should be average rating plus,
not minus, plus, constant / square root of # of reviews.
Is that it?
Are there other corrections that can benefit scores of restaurants at
the population level?
Well, for one, the freshness of ratings or reviews is important.
This is especially important in the context of restaurants.
As time progresses, the restaurant can become better or worse,
depending on many factors.
Including changes in chef, management, or whatnot.
Therefore, it may make sense to put more weight on recent restaurant ratings,
compared to those further in the past.
So how do we account for this?
In computing average rating, we shall assign weights to the ratings.
You see, before, we assigned uniform weight to each review or rating.
But now, we can assign weight to each review or rating depending upon its age.
For example, if we think of half-life,
remember half life the way we think of in nuclear physics?
Let's think of a half-life of a restaurant as 3 months.
That is, this is time scale at which changes in restaurants become relevant.
Then we can define normalized age of review as actual age of review / 3 months.
So for example, if the restaurant had a rating 12 months back,
then the normalized age would be 4.
And then the weight of the review would be exponential of (-4).
Says that as age increases, the rate decreases.
Now, the new weighted average score would be computed as follows.
(weight review 1 x score review 1) + (weight review 2 x score review 2)...
/ weight of review 1 + weigh review 2...
Okay? Again,
remember previously weights were uniform, that is, equal to one.
Now we are gonna change that.
And correction in this average score would be given by, as before,
a constant divided by square root.
But not square root of just number of samples.
But a weighted sum of the reviews.
That is, weight review 1 + weight review 2..., there's a small twist.
We will also divide this number by the maximum of
the weights among all end reviews.
Again, if you remember when weights of all reviews were equal in the earlier setting.
This will be nothing but the square root of number of samples.
In summary, in this section, we learned the following.
The average rating or
score is an excellent proxy of the restaurant's true score.
That is, we learned the algorithm of population averages.
Now, due to a limited number of reviews or ratings in the context of restaurants,
it needed an adjustment.
Conservative adjustments suggest reducing rating depending upon the number of
reviews.
Fewer reviews leading to more reduction.
More reviews leading to smaller reduction.
Optimistic adjustments suggest increasing
rating depending upon the number of reviews.
With fewer reviews leading to more increase.
The freshness of ratings is very important to take into account.
Weigh recent ratings more compared to older ratings.
So this is the end of the section on how to use population averages.
In the next section, we are going to understand how to use population averages
when data is in the form of comparisons.
Thank you.
